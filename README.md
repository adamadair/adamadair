## 🧠 About Me
👋 Hi, I’m @adamadair

I write code like I brew beer — with precision, passion, and occasionally while yelling at Arsenal on the TV.

By day, I wrangle software into submission with the power of strongly typed languages and caffeine. By night, I brew small-batch beer and take tactical naps with my cats (they're the real masterminds).

Some developers write spaghetti code. I write it al dente.

## ⚽ Arsenal FC

Yes, I support Arsenal. No, I don’t want to talk about the 2006 Champions League Final. Or that other time. Or that other-other time. Look — we’re building something special, OK?

## 🧰 Tools of the Trade

- C# / .NET / SQL — because real devs use semicolons.
- Git — so I can undo my mistakes with style.
- Pop!_OS — because I like my Linux with a side of pizzazz.
- Beer Yeast — technically not a dev tool, but it *does* run processes in the background.

## 🛏️ Fun Facts

- I consider naps a form of agile recovery.
- My cats have more GitHub followers than I do.
- I once built a REST API that ghosted me. I still miss her.
- My brewpub dreams are on hold until I figure out how to make a stout that doesn't insult me.

## 🧪 Motto

**“Ship code. Sip beer. Support Arsenal. Nap like a champ.”**
